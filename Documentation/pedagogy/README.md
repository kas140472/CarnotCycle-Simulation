#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Experimentation

<u>About the Experiment:</u><br>

Carnot cycle is an ideal thermodynamics cycle proposed by the French physicist Sadi Carnot. It consists of two isothermal and two reversible adiabatic curves. The cycle provides the maximum possible efficiency that can be obtained by any thermodynamic cycle.

The various processes involved are explained below:

1-2 - This is the isothermal heat addition phase, where there is a reversible adiabatic (or isentropic) heat transfer from the hot reservoir at constant temperature.

2-3 - This is the isentropic expansion phase, where the gas in the engine is thermally insulated from the hot and cold reservoirs and expanded.

3-4 - This is the isothermal heat removal phase, where there is a reversible adiabatic (or isentropic) heat transfer to the cold reservoir at constant temperature.

4-1 - This is the isentropic compression phase, where the gas in the engine is thermall insulated from the hot and cold reservoirs and compressed.

In this experiment, the Carnot cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>

The experiment consists of the Carnot cycle P-V graph. All the buttons and parameters are on the right side of the frame. The variable panel contains sliders for the pressures P1 and P3 and the volumes V1 and V2.

The setup consists of a graph that depicts the Carnot cycle. A legend at the top indicates the processes involved in each of the curves.

By changing the various parameters, the P-V graph changes.

1. The initial P<sub>1</sub> is taken as 1.1 kPa. <br>
2. The initial P<sub>3</sub> is taken as 0.1 kPa. <br>
3. The initial V<sub>1</sub> is taken as 2 m<sup>3</sup>. <br>
4. The initial V<sub>2</sub> is taken as 6 m<sup>3</sup>. <br>
5. P<sub>1</sub> is varied from 1.1 to 1.5 kPa using a slider. <br>
6. P<sub>3</sub> is varied from 0.1 to 0.25 kPa using a slider. <br>
7. V<sub>1</sub> is varied from 2 to 5 m<sup>3</sup> using a slider. <br>
8. V<sub>2</sub> is varied from 6 to 9 m<sup>3</sup> using a slider. <br>
